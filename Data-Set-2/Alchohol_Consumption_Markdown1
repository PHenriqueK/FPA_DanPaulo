## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

Alchohol_Raw <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

attach(Alchohol_Raw)

summary(beer_servings)
summary(spirit_servings)
summary(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)
summary(wine_servings)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(beer_servings)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(Alchohol_Raw[-1], method = "pearson")
plot(beer_servings, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)
abline(lm(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol~beer_servings))
text(beer_servings, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, 
     labels = country, cex = .5, pos = 4, col = "green")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top6 <- head(Alchohol_Raw)
par(las = 2)
barplot(top6$beer_servings, main = "Beer Servings", xlab = "Country", ylab = "Liters",
        names.arg = c("Afghanistan", "Albania", "Algeria", "Andorra", "Angola", "Antigua & Barbuda"), 
        border = "black", col = "blue")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
