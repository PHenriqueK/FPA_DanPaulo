##Tasks

The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. 

Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository that should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. 

The repository will include R source code files that access at least two data sets from fivethirtyeight, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. 

At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged.
